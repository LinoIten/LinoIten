# 🌟 Reviews

> *Simplicity is beauty. That's it, if you are looking for a game to remove your stress, to enjoy, or a game that you can play without committing lots of your time. This is the game for you.*
>   - John Mendoza

> *Congratulations, you've contributed a new genre to the Play Store. An impressive dynamic game, perfect for those with limited time, ideal for those who want to get addicted just the right amount. The game features a gacha-like system, where every 5 minutes you take a step that corresponds to an action that can be chosen each turn. This makes in-game items limited and creates a highly efficient community market. In love with this game, congrats on the creativity!*
